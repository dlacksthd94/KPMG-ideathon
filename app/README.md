# NewsNet

## Project Description
**NewsNet** is a tool designed to help users collect, analyze, and visualize information from news articles and industry reports. The tool was created in response to the problem that a large quantity of news articles contain valuable information, but are often too distributed for humans to effectively utilize.

Our tool addresses this problem by allowing users to input a keyword or phrase, which the tool uses to **collect** relevant news articles and industry reports from a variety of sources. The tool then uses name entity recognition (NER) to **extract** relevant information, such as key concepts, entities, and relationships, from the articles. This information is then **integrated** into a knowledge graph, which provides users with a visual representation of the key concepts and relationships between them.
